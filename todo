passives listed below can be linked together in any way to create new attacks, more links = higher cooldown, different passives increase the cooldown by different amounts
the basic attack it all starts from is a single projectile being shot which has a fixed duration alive
for instance, 2 projectiles + fork + ricochet + laser will make you shoot 2 lasers that bounce off walls and fork into 2 new lasers (once) whenever they hit enemies

N projectiles          = shoots N projectiles at a 45 degree angle
N parallel projectiles = shoots N projectiles parallel to each other
2 side projectiles     = shoots 2 projectiles at a 90 degree angle
faster attack speed    = decreases the attacks cooldown
N burst                = shoots a burst of N projectiles and increases cooldown between bursts
fork                   = projectiles fork at a 45 degree angle on enemy hit
split                  = projectiles fork at a 90 degree angle on enemy or solid hit
pierce                 = projectiles pierce  enemies
scatter                = projectiles fork, split and ricochet off walls multiple times, each new projectile created has reduced damage and increased speed
spark                  = projectiles move forward randomly and quickly in an unpredictable pattern
phase                  = projectiles go through solids
chain                  = projectiles chain through enemies
ricochet               = projectiles ricochet off solids
homing                 = projectiles seek enemies
avoid                  = projectiles avoid enemies
boomerang              = projectile moves around in the path of a boomerang and comes back
explosive              = projectile explodes into multiple projectiles
area on contact        = creates an area of damage when the projectile hits an enemy or a solid
moving area            = creates an area around the projectile that moves with it and deals dot to enemies, the projectile itself deals no damage but pierces through enemies
nova                   = shoots projectiles in a circle
accelerating           = projectiles gain speed with time
decelerating           = projectiles lose speed with time
spread                 = shoots projectiles randomly within a 30/45/60/90 degree angle
spiral                 = projectile spirals outward
orbit                  = projectile orbits at a constant distance
staged                 = hold the attack to shoot an increasingly more powerful version
charged                = releases secondary projectiles of increasing power but with short duration, resets their power if attack is pressed
secondary              = shoots a secondary projectile which shoots the main projectile after a duration
drone                  = creates a drone that shoots projectiles instead, the drone inherits linked passives and chases enemies around
silence                = shoots projectiles that have a chance to silence enemies (silenced enemies cant attack)
slow                   = shoots projectiles that have a chance to slow enemies (slow enemies move slower)
chain lightning        = projectiles generate chain lightning on enemy hit
heal                   = shoots projectiles that have a chance to heal enemies
unleash                = the longer you dont attack the longer you store up projectiles, on attack all of them are released as a burst of projectiles in a wide angle
proximity mine         = creates proximity mines that shoot projectiles instead, theyre triggered when there are enemies nearby
sentry                 = creates a sentry that shoots projectiles instead, the sentry inherits linked passives, cant move, and has an inbuilt long trigger range
duration               = increases the duration of created projectiles or constructs (mines, sentry, drone)
shotgun                = shoots many projectiles at the same time, like a shotgun
laser                  = shoots a laser, internally the laser is composed of very fast projectiles so all projectile passives also apply to it
shield                 = projectiles have a shield that prevents them from being damaged by other projectiles N times
weaken                 = shoots projectiles that have a chance to weaken enemies (weakened enemies take increased damage)
stun                   = shoots projectiles that have a chance to stun enemies (stunned enemies cant move nor attack)
knockback              = shoots projectiles that push enemies back
pull                   = shoots projectiles that pull enemies towards you
telekinesis            = projectiles shot remain still until you release the attack button, and then they all start moving
root                   = shoots projectiles that have a chance to root enemies (rooted enemies cant move)
spawn                  = shoots projectiles that spawn secondary projectiles
radiation              = areas or lasers radiate secondary projectiles
increased area         = increases the area for areas, lasers or constructs
decreased area         = decreases the area for areas, lasers or constructs, but also increases damage
increased speed        = increases the projectiles speed
decreased speed        = decreases the projectiles speed
critical hit           = enemies hit by this projectile will have their weak spots revealed, further hits on weak spots deal double damage
trail                  = projectiles create a trail of areas/pools that deal dot
finale                 = every Nth projectile a more powerful version is shot, cooldown slightly increased before next sequence
chain damage           = increased damage per chain
